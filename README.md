# Predictive-Modeling-for-NASDAQ-Closing-Auctions
Introduction
This project is a culmination of our efforts to understand and model the NASDAQ closing auction, where the final prices of stocks are determined. Our aim is to unravel the intricacies behind the short-term price movements during the auction's critical 10-minute window.

Project Objective
Goal: Predict the forward price movements during the NASDAQ's Closing Cross Auction.

Data Analysis:
Conducting a thorough examination of the dataset to glean insights into the auction process and key influencing factors.

Data Preparation:
Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data integrity and readiness for modeling.

Feature Engineering:
Developing new features from financial indicators and auction dynamics to enhance our predictive model.

Technical Indicators:
Integrating established technical indicators such as EMA, VMA, and Volatility.

Predictive Modeling:
Employing advanced machine learning techniques to build and train our predictive model.

Model Evaluation:
Using rigorous metrics to evaluate the model's performance and identify opportunities for refinement.

By following this structured approach, we aim to build a model that not only predicts with accuracy but also offers valuable insights into the closing auction mechanics.
